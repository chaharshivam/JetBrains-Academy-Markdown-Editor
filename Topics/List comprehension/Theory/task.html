<h2>List comprehension</h2>
<p><strong>List comprehension </strong>is a way of making new lists. It allows you to create a list from any iterable object in a concise and efficient manner. See the basic syntax below:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python"># list comprehension syntax
new_list = [x for x in some_iterable]</code></pre>

<p>Here you can see that list comprehension is specified by <strong>square brackets</strong> (just like the list itself) inside which you have a <strong>for </strong>loop over some iterable object. In our example, <code class="language-python">new_list</code> will simply consist of all elements from some_iterable object. The code above is completely equivalent to the one below, however, it takes less space and works a little bit faster!</p>

<pre><code class="language-python"># the equivalent code
new_list = []
for x in some_iterable:
    new_list.append(x)</code></pre>

<p>You may wonder why there is a need for list comprehensions at all since we have a <code class="language-python">list()</code> function. Obviously, list comprehensions are used not just for copying elements from some iterable into a list, but mainly for modifying them in some way to create a specific new list. In this case, in the first place of the list comprehension, we write some function of our variable. For example, the code below shows how to create a list of squared numbers.</p>

<pre><code class="language-python"># squared numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
square_list = [x * x for x in numbers]  # [1, 4, 9]</code></pre>

<p>Also, we can use list comprehensions to convert elements of a list from one data type to another:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python"># from string to float
strings = ["8.9", "6.0", "8.1", "7.5"]
floats = [float(num) for num in strings]  # [8.9, 6.0, 8.1, 7.5]</code></pre>

<h5 id="list-comprehension-with-if" style="text-align: center;">List comprehension with if</h5>

<p>Another way to modify the original iterable object is by introducing the <strong>if statement</strong> into the list comprehension. The basic syntax is this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python"># list comprehension with condition
new_list = [x for x in some_iterable if condition]</code></pre>

<p>The conditional statement allows you to filter the elements of the original collection and work only with the elements you need. The if statement works here as a part of a comprehension syntax. The filtering condition is not an obligatory part, but it can be very useful. For instance, here it is used to create a list of odd numbers from another list:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python"># odd numbers
numbers = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42, 108]
odd_list = [x for x in numbers if x % 2 == 1]  # [15, 23]</code></pre>

<p>You can also modify the condition by using standard methods. For instance, if you want to create a list of words that end in <em>-tion</em>, you can do it like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python"># conditions with functions
text = ["function", "is", "a", "synonym", "of", "occupation"]
words_tion = [word for word in text if word.endswith("tion")]  
print(words_tion)  # ["function", "occupation"]</code></pre>

<p>Finally, we can introduce the <code class="language-python">else</code> statement in list comprehension. The syntax here differs a bit: <code class="language-python">[x if condition else y for x in some_iterable]</code>. Using this, we can, for example, get 0 in a new list for each negative number in the old list:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">old_list = [8, 13, -7, 4, -9, 2, 10]
new_list = [num if num &gt;= 0 else 0 for num in old_list]
print(new_list)  # [8, 13, 0, 4, 0, 2, 10]</code></pre>

<p>In general, list comprehension should be used with caution: where it gains in efficiency it loses in readability. Nevertheless, it is a very useful tool and we hope you'll use it in your programs! </p>
