<h2>A simple interest calculation</h2>
<html><body><p>Below you can find a simple program that performs simple interest calculation. The part that asks a user for the needed data has already been written for you. Now you need to write the final parts that will do all the heavy lifting:</p>
<ul>
<li><code class="java">calculate()</code> should perform interest calculation and <strong>return</strong> the final interest amount and the total sum.</li>
<li><code class="java">print_result()</code> should <strong>print</strong> out the final interest amount and the total sum, as shown in the Sample Output below.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is the formula for calculating the interest: $ interest = \frac {amount \times interest\;rate \times time}{100}$</p>
<p>In the Sample Input below, the first number is the starting amount, followed by the interest rate in % and the number of years.</p>
<p>You do <strong>NOT</strong> need to call the functions, just complete them!</p></body></html><br><b>Sample Input:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">1000<br>8<br>5</code></pre><br><b>Sample Output:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">The interest is: 400.0<br>The total amount is: 1400.0</code></pre><br><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 15 seconds</font><br><br>
<b>Caution</b><br><br>
You may see errors in your code or execution results due to missing context. Donâ€™t worry about it, just write the solution and press Check.
