<h2>Reading files</h2>
<p>If you have a file, you might want to view its contents. In this topic, you'll learn different ways to read files in Python.</p>

<h5 id="read-file" style="text-align: center;">Read file</h5>

<p>To read the file, first we need to open it in the reading mode. Now that the file is opened, how does the actual reading part go? Let's first choose a file that we want to read. So, imagine we have a file called '<strong>animals.txt' </strong>that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Dog
Cat
Rabbit
Sea turtle
Penguin</code></pre>

<p>To read the file, you can:</p>

<ul>
	<li>use the <code class="language-python">read(size)</code> method;</li>
	<li>use the <code class="language-python">readline(size)</code>  method;</li>
	<li>use the <code class="language-python">readlines()</code>  method;</li>
	<li>iterate over the lines with a <code class="language-python">for</code> loop.</li>
</ul>

<p>The first three ways are special file object methods while the last one is a general Python loop. Let's go over them one by one.</p>

<h5 id="read" style="text-align: center;">read()</h5>

<p><code class="language-python">read(size)</code> reads the <code class="language-python">size</code> bytes of a file. If the parameter isn't specified, the whole file is read into a single variable. So, this is what we'll get if we apply it to our file:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">file = open('animals.txt', 'r')
print(file.read())
# The output:
# Dog
# Cat
# Rabbit
# Sea turtle
# Penguin

file.close()</code></pre>

<h5 id="readline" style="text-align: center;">readline()</h5>

<p><code class="language-python">readline(size)</code> is similar to <code class="language-python">read(size)</code> but it reads <code class="language-python">size</code> bytes from a single line, not the whole file. Lines in files are separated by <strong>newline</strong> escape sequences: <code class="language-python">'\n'</code>, <code class="language-python">'\r'</code> or <code class="language-python">'\r\n'</code>. We'll settle on <code class="language-python">'\n'</code> in this topic. Yet, keep in mind that this escape sequence depends on your operating system.</p>

<p>Let's proceed with our example. The file '<strong>animals.txt'</strong> contains 5 lines. Here is what we'll get if we try to read 3 bytes from each line:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">file = open('animals.txt', 'r')
print(file.readline(3))
print(file.readline(3))
print(file.readline(3))
print(file.readline(3))
print(file.readline(3))
print(file.readline(3))

# The output:
# Dog
# 
# 
# Cat
# 
# 
# Rab
# bit


file.close()</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, the output does not contain the first three characters from all 5 lines. This is because when we specify the <code class="language-python">size</code> parameter, we get <code class="language-python">size</code> bytes from the line until it ends and only then go to another line. The newline character is considered as a part of the line here. So, in our example, we need two passes of <code class="language-python">readline(3)</code> to read the first line which has three characters and a newline character (4 bytes in total). This is where all those empty lines in the output come from.</p>

<h5 id="readlines" style="text-align: center;">readlines()</h5>

<p><code class="language-python">readlines()</code> allows us to read the whole file as a list of lines. Here's what it looks like:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">file = open('animals.txt', 'r')
print(file.readlines())
# The output:
# ['Dog\n', 'Cat\n', 'Rabbit\n', 'Sea turtle\n', 'Penguin']

file.close()</code></pre>

<p>Here you can actually see that the newline character is a part of the line! This method works well when the files are small, but for large files, this may be inefficient.</p>

<h5 id="for-loop" style="text-align: center;">for loop</h5>

<p>The most efficient way to read the contents of a file is to iterate over its lines with <code class="language-python">for</code> loop.</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">file = open('animals.txt', 'r')
for line in file:
    print(line)

# The output:
# Dog
# 
# Cat
# 
# Rabbit
# 
# Sea turtle
# 
# Penguin

file.close() </code></pre>

<p>This is the best way to read large files because we can just work with one line at a time or work with specific lines and discard the rest.</p>

<h5 id="summary" style="text-align: center;">Summary</h5>

<p>So, in this topic, we've seen how to read the file's contents. This skill is quite useful because sometimes it's easier or more convenient to read a file using Python than to open it directly. Again, these are the available ways to do it:</p>

<ul>
	<li><code class="language-python">read()</code> method reads the file as a whole;</li>
	<li><code class="language-python">readline()</code> reads the file one line at a time;</li>
	<li><code class="language-python">readlines()</code> reads the file as a list of lines.</li>
	<li>the best way, however, is to use <code class="language-python">for</code> loop to iterate over the lines of the file.</li>
</ul>
