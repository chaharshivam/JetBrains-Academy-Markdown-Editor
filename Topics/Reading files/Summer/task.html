<p>Please note: for now, when you go to the tab IDE, you can solve this problem only via Pycharm. We are sorry for the inconvenience, we will fix this as soon as we can. If you prefer to solve the problem via a different IDE, you should open it manually and then copy the solution to the website.</p>

<p>Count how many times the word <u><em>summer</em></u> appears in the file. The file contains only one word per line, all of them are lowercased. Mind that if <em>summer </em>is a part of some other word (e.g. <em>summertime</em>) you should <strong>NOT</strong> count it. We only need <em>summers </em>themselves!</p>
<p>Remember that here you need to enter a resulting number, not your code!</p></body></html><br>
