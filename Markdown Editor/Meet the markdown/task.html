<p>Welcome to the first stage of the project! </p>
<p>If you have worked with the markdown, you will probably recognize the following syntax:</p>
<pre><code class="language-markdown"># The Beatles
One may say that they were the most famous **rock band** ever.
The legendary **line-up** comprised the following people:
* *John Lennon*
* *Paul McCartney*
* *George Harrison*
* *Ringo Starr*</code></pre>
<p>Yes! It is a raw markdown code. It translates into:</p>
<h5 id="the-beatles">The Beatles</h5>
<p>One may say that they were the most famous <strong>rock band</strong> ever.<br/>
The legendary <strong>line-up</strong> comprised the following people:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>John Lennon</em></li>
<li><em>Paul McCartney</em></li>
<li><em>George Harrison</em></li>
<li><em>Ringo Starr</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Print the source (raw) markdown code of the markdown snippet below. Show your understanding of the syntax basics. You can use <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">the Markdown Guide</a> as it covers all the necessary topics.</p>
<p>Below is the snippet to complete this stage. Here you can see such elements as the <strong>heading</strong>, the <strong>italicized</strong> text, the <strong>strikethrough</strong> text, the text both <strong>italicized</strong> and <strong>bold</strong> (you can surround it with triple <code class="language-markdown">*</code> on each end, for instance: <code class="language-markdown">***Lennon***</code>), and an <strong>unordered</strong> <strong>list</strong>. Once you write the snippet in the markdown syntax, put it into triple quotes and print it:</p>
<h5 id="john-lennon">John Lennon</h5>
<p>or <em><strong>John Winston Ono Lennon</strong></em> was one of <em>The Beatles</em>.<br/>
Here are the songs he wrote I like the most:</p>
<ul>
<li>Imagine</li>
<li>Norwegian Wood</li>
<li>Come Together</li>
<li>In My Life</li>
<li><strike>Hey Jude</strike> (that was <em>McCartney</em>)</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="example">Example</h5>
<p>Take a look at the snippet below. This example is for reference only.</p>
<h5 id="the-list-of-albums">The List of Albums</h5>
<p>During their history, a lot of great albums were released.<br/>
These are my favorite:</p>
<ol>
<li>Abbey Road</li>
<li>Rubber Soul</li>
<li>Revolver</li>
<li>A Hard Day's Night</li>
</ol>
<p>To reconstruct the snippet's structure with markdown, you would have needed to print the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-markdown"># The List of Albums
During their history, a lot of great albums were released.
These are my favorite:
1. Abbey Road
2. Rubber Soul
3. Revolver
4. A Hard Day's Night</code></pre></body></html>
